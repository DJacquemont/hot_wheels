    "## Abstract\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> This project is part of the course Basics of mobile robotics (ME-452). The goal is to create a software enabling the Thymio to find its path through a set of obstacles. To this end, it will need to localize itself as well as its environment, and find the best path to the goal to then drive to it. Another challenge is for it to avoid any unexpected object it meets. This project is thus split in four distinct modules, plus the main file. Those four modules are: </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Vision</b>, camera based function and transformation for position, goal and terrain exctraction\n",
    "- <b>Kalman Filter</b>, sensor fusion for accurate odometry computation\n",
    "- <b>Optimal path algorithm</b>, path optimization using Dijkstra\n",
    "- <b>Motion control</b>, in charge of the Thymio's motion and local avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice for our environment was intended to be the easiest to detect for the camera, and therefore the most robust. The obstacles are random geometrical black forms, and the goal is a red rectangle. For the Thymio's position to be always detectable and more robust to changes in brightness, its LEDs were activated.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> This module includes functions converting the information percieved by the camera into a map, a goal and the current position of the robot. To this end, the image obtained from the camera is first filtered using a median filter, useful to remove the noise while preserving clear edges.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visibility graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The obstacles are represented by black shapes. In order to fetch the map, function <b>terrainFetch</b> computing the visibility graph is called. Pixel segmentation is done on the retrieved image, followed by a blob analysis only conserving blobs of a certain size (filtering leftover noise). These blobs are then dilated to account for the robot's size, and the corners for each dilated blob are computed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order the find the dilated blobs' corners, the function <b>cornerHarris</b> is called from the OpenCV library. This function filters the image using a Gaussian filter to smooth out any noise. The gradient of the image is then calculated in both x and y directions using a Sobel filter. The gradient values are then used to compute the \"cornerness\" martrix measuring the strength of the corner at each pixel in the image. The matrix is then thresholded to select only the strongest corners in the image, and finally the coordinates of the identified corners are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The start and end point (i.e. start position of the robot and goal position) are also fetched (using functions detailed bellow), and added to the previous nodes (i.e. corners of the dilated blobs). To check weither the nodes are connected, each node is iterating over all the node, checking wether it has a direct connection (without intersecting a dilated blobs). This function returns the position of the nodes in meters, their connections, and the dilated obstacles' mask (displayed in the visual interface).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thymio pose\n",
    "\n",
    "Function <b>poseFetch</b> fetches the robots' position and angle thanks to the Thymio's red (angle) and green (position & angle) LEDs. The position is computed by first running a pixel segmentation and blob analysis to only keep the two green blobs. The center of those two blobs is found and the middle between those two points is defined to be the position of the robot. The center of the red blob is obtained with the same transformations (this time for one blob only), and the angle of the robot is resolved when comparing the two center found (center of the red blob, and center of the two green blobs) with respect to the X axis (i.e. using the arctan). The position of the robot is returned in pixel since this function is used in <b>terrainFetch</b>, but the position in meter is returned by the function <b>fetchOdoMeters</b>, calling <b>odoFetch</b> multiple times and converting the result in meter.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal position\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal represented by a red square piece of paper is fetched with function <b>goalFetch</b>. It is retreived by performing the same transformation as done for the position : pixel segmentation followed by blob analysis to check the size of the blob and avoid noise. The goal is thus the center of the blob and is returned in meters.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a visual feedback on what the algorithm outputs, function <b>liveFeedback</b> was created, it prints each node and their connections, the dilated obstacles, the robot's current position and angle, and the goal position.</div>\n",

    "## 2. Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the Thymio is estimated using a Kalman filter. The choice for a kalman filter was made because we decided for the global navigation to use nodes described in a coordinate system with x and y coordinates. Thus, also the position of the Thymio should be estimated in that coordinate system. Since we have multiple sensor readings: vision and wheel encoder, the Kalman filter was selected to fuse these measurements.\n",

The <b> actu_path </b> list is updated using <b>idx_min</b> and <b>tabPath</b>. Iteration will then just go to the number of nodes.
